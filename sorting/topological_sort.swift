/// Topological sort is an algorithm that orders a directed graph such that for each directed edge uâ†’v, vertex u comes before vertex v.
///
/// In other words, a topological sort places the vertices of a directed acyclic graph on a line so that all directed edges go from left to right.

/// How does it work?

/// Step 1: Find all vertices that have in-degree of 0

/// Step 1: Find all vertices that have in-degree of 0

/// The in-degree of a vertex is the number of edges pointing at that vertex. Vertices with no incoming edges have an in-degree of 0. These vertices are the starting points for the topological sort.

/// In the context of the previous example, these starting vertices represent algorithms and data structures that don't have any prerequisites; you don't need to learn anything else first, hence the sort starts with them.

/// Step 2: Traverse the graph with depth-first search

/// Depth-first search is an algorithm that starts traversing the graph from a certain vertex and explores as far as possible along each branch before backtracking. To find out more about depth-first search, please take a look at the detailed explanation.

/// We perform a depth-first search on each vertex with in-degree 0. This tells us which vertices are connected to each of these starting vertices.

/// Step 3: Remember all visited vertices

/// As we perform the depth-first search, we maintain a list of all the vertices that have been visited. This is to avoid visiting the same vertex twice.

/// Step 4: Put it all together

/// The last step of the sort is to combine the results of the different depth-first searches and put the vertices in a sorted list.
